# Northcoders News Frontend (northcoders-new-frontend)

This Vite project uses the React framework to build a single-page application. It uses React Router to display multiple views without reloading the page, improving user experience by reducing load times. It makes use of the data made available from the back-end to display content dynamically, and allows users to interact with that data. For example, users can:

- Sign in or out
- Upvote/ downvote and comment on articles
- Sort articles by date and popularity
- Filter by topic
